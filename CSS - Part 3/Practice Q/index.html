    <h1> I'm Nobody! Who are you? </h1>

    <div>
        I'm Nobody! Who are you?
        Are you - Nobody - too?
        Then there's a pair of us!
        Dont tell! they'd banish us - you know!

        How dreary - to be - Somebody!
        How public - like a Frog -
        To tell your name - the livelong June -
        To an admiring Bog!

    </div>

    <div>
        I have been made anew
        like the first hour of sun
        after days of rain.
        I have kissed the face
        of the life that took from me
        the only life I knew. Made anew,
        I have let love render me
        surrendered, naked
        as a speck of dust in a beam
        of day let loose from an opened
        fist. I have kissed the fist open.
