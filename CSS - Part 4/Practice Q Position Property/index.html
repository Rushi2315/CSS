    <p>Novel as a literary genre enjoyed the highest level of glory in the 18 th century. The authors namely Defoe,
        Richardson, Fielding and Sterne contributed significantly to the development of English novel. They influenced
        the writers who came after them. The 18 th century coincided with the industrial revolution which sign ificantly
        contributed to the rise of the novel (with the invention of printing machine). The chain effects of industrial
        revolution improved people's life and living standard. The rise of the educated middle class people further
        increased the reading publi c which correspondingly led to demand of novels for reading. Books such as 'Don
        Quixote', 'Decameron', 'Morte d' Arthur' and 'Pilgrim's Progress' laid the foundations for the development of
        the novel. 'Pamela', 'Joseph Andrew's, 'Tristram Shandy', and 'Robinson Crusoe' were some of the notable books
        that became famous in the 18 th century. However, novels continued to evolve in the 19 th and 20 th century
        giving rise to different genres or classes of novel. <br>
